    "What does it mean to learn?  Learning is a process where we take a series of observations and draw conclusions based on past experiences.  For example, we can learn to recognize patterns in experiential data such as when I take the later bus, I'm late to work.  Machine Learning is when we teach a computer to do the same thing, namely find patterns in data.  The idea is that humans are really great at finding patterns, but relatively slow at looking through large amounts of data.  Computers need to be trained to find the patterns, but they can process data of the sort of we have (csv files, images, etc) incredibly fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "The revolution of Machine Learning has its roots in two main factors\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A massive amount of newly generated data\n",
    "2. A massive improvement in computer memory and performance\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to leverage machine learning, we need to learn to teach computers to recognize patterns and leverage that ability to solve real world patterns.  Lets start with a really simple example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have one dimensional data given by a single feature $X$ and a corresponding set of labels $y$.  We want to model this data, so we will create a relationship $f(X) \\approx y$.  This function $f$ will represent our model.  We will generate the data here by randomly choosing an exponent for a trend and adding some random noise.  Let's create the data and see what this looks like."

In the context of Machine Learning, this is called a Linear Regression and is a quite powerful and general method to learn.  Just this example opens up many questions we will be answering in later lectures:\n",

In supervised learning we are trying to learn a predictive relationship between **features** of our data and some sort of output label. In unsupervised learning we want to find trends in our features without using any target labels. Unsupervised learning typically relies on reducing the dimensionality of the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A human example of supervised learning would be borrowing books from a library on mathematics and geography. By reading different books belonging to each topic, we learn what symbols, images, and words are associated with math, and which are associated with geography. A similar unsupervised task would be to borrow many books without knowing their subject. We can see some books contain similar images (maps) and some books contain similar symbols (e.g. the Greek letters $\\Sigma$ and $\\pi$). We say the books containing maps are similar and that they are different from the books containing Greek letters. Crucially, _we do not know what the books are about, only that they are similar or different_.\n",

    "Formally, the supervised machine problem can be stated as given a matrix $X$, of dimensions $n \\times p$, create a predictive relationship (or function) $f(X)$ where $f(X) \\approx y$, where $y$ is a vector of dimension $n$.  $X$ is referred to as the **feature matrix** and $y$ as the **labels**.\n",
