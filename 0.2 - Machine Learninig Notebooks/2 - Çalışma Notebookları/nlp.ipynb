The grader will use the passed `predict` method to evaluate how your model performs on a test set with respect to a reference model. The grader uses the [R<sup>2</sup>-score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#r2-score) for model evaluation. If your model performs better than the reference solution, then you can score higher than 1.0. For the last question, you will submit the result of an analysis and your passed answer will be compared directly to the reference solution.\n",

The naive Bayes model calculates probabilities such as $P(\\text{terrible } | \\text{ negative})$, the probability the review is negative given the word \"terrible\" appears in the text. Using these probabilities, we can derive a polarity score for each counted word,\n",
